It's just a project for me to kill time.
# About the cross platform
Qt is a cross-platform framework, and C++ is a cross-platform language, so theoretically it can be run on many desktop and mobile platform, including Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, MacOS and etc., though I only made a Windows and an Android platform executable file. If you want to use it on your Linux or MacOS devices, you can compile it by using the qmake under your platform.
# About the Android version
The Android version was merely written to adjust the mobile phone's resolution, the basic principle is the same(except for the click logic).
